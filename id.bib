Traditional IoT authentication schemes are based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) where a centralized certificate authority is introduced. To mitigate the security, privacy, and reliability issues bring from the centralization, some blockchain-based authentication schemes have been presented to achieve decentralized authentication. Unfortunately, they cannot be directly used under the fog-based IoT environment, which consists of resource-constrained IoT devices. To mitigate these issues, we present a Blockchain-enabled reliable, and Privacy-preserving Authentication for Fog-based IoT devices, named BPAF. BPAF achieves reliable authentication of fog nodes without violating the privacy of authenticated users during the authentication process. Security analysis and experimental evaluations show that BPAF achieves privacy-preserving and reliable authentication with high efficiency for both the fog nodes and full nodes participating in the authentication process.},

However, due to the limited computing power and storage capacity of IoT devices, users' health data are generally stored in a centralized third party, such as the hospital database or cloud, and make users lose control of their health data, which can easily result in privacy leakage and single-point bottleneck. In this paper, we propose Healthchain, a large-scale health data privacy preserving scheme based on blockchain technology, where health data are encrypted to conduct fine-grained access control. Specifically, users can effectively revoke or add authorized doctors by leveraging user transactions for key management. Furthermore, by introducing Healthchain, both IoT data and doctor diagnosis cannot be deleted or tampered with so as to avoid medical disputes. Security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed Healthchain is applicable for smart healthcare system.},

	abstract = {Digital identity is one of the oldest and hardest problems on the Internet. There is still no way to use digital credentials to prove our online identity the same way we do in the offline world. This is finally changing. First, the World Wide Web Consortium is standardizing the format of digitally-signed credentials. Secondly, public blockchains can provide decentralized registration and discovery of the public keys needed to verify digital signatures. These two steps pave the way to establish a global public utility for self-sovereign identity—lifetime portable digital identity that does not depend on any central authority and can never be taken away. The Sovrin Network has been designed exclusively for this purpose, including governance (the Sovrin Foundation and the Sovrin Trust Framework), scalability (validator and observer nodes and state proofs), and accessibility (minimal cost and maximum availability). Most importantly, Sovrin implements Privacy by Design on a global scale, including pairwise pseudonymous identifiers, peer-to-peer private agents, and selective disclosure of personal data using zero-knowledge proof cryptography. The emergence of this infrastructure can transform at least four major markets: identity and access management, cybersecurity, RegTech, and data integration. To provide economic incentives for credential issuers, owners, and verifiers, the Sovrin protocol will incorporate a digital token designed expressly for privacy-preserving value exchange. The Sovrin token should enable a global marketplace for digital credentials of all types and value levels together with ancillary markets for digital credential insurance and permissioned first party data (direct from the customer).
