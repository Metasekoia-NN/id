	abstract   = {As the voucher for identity, digital certificates and the public key infrastructure (PKI) system have always played a vital role to provide the authentication services. In recent years, with the increase in attacks on traditional centralized PKIs and the extensive deployment of blockchains, researchers have tried to establish blockchain-based secure decentralized PKIs and have made significant progress. Although blockchain enhances security, it brings new problems in scalability due to the inherent limitations of blockchain’s data structure and consensus mechanism, which become much severe for the massive access in the era of 5G and B5G. In this paper, we propose ScalaCert to mitigate the scalability problems of blockchain-based PKIs by utilizing redactable blockchain for "on-cert" revocation. Specifically, we utilize the redactable blockchain to record revocation information directly on the original certificate ("on-cert") and remove additional data structures such as CRL, significantly reducing storage overhead. Moreover, the combination of redactable and consortium blockchains brings a new kind of attack called deception of versions (DoV) attack. To defend against it, we design a random-block-node-check (RBNC) based freshness check mechanism. Security and performance analyses show that ScalaCert has sufficient security and effectively solves the scalability problem of the blockchain-based PKI system.},

Traditional IoT authentication schemes are based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) where a centralized certificate authority is introduced. To mitigate the security, privacy, and reliability issues bring from the centralization, some blockchain-based authentication schemes have been presented to achieve decentralized authentication. Unfortunately, they cannot be directly used under the fog-based IoT environment, which consists of resource-constrained IoT devices. To mitigate these issues, we present a Blockchain-enabled reliable, and Privacy-preserving Authentication for Fog-based IoT devices, named BPAF. BPAF achieves reliable authentication of fog nodes without violating the privacy of authenticated users during the authentication process. Security analysis and experimental evaluations show that BPAF achieves privacy-preserving and reliable authentication with high efficiency for both the fog nodes and full nodes participating in the authentication process.},

However, due to the limited computing power and storage capacity of IoT devices, users' health data are generally stored in a centralized third party, such as the hospital database or cloud, and make users lose control of their health data, which can easily result in privacy leakage and single-point bottleneck. In this paper, we propose Healthchain, a large-scale health data privacy preserving scheme based on blockchain technology, where health data are encrypted to conduct fine-grained access control. Specifically, users can effectively revoke or add authorized doctors by leveraging user transactions for key management. Furthermore, by introducing Healthchain, both IoT data and doctor diagnosis cannot be deleted or tampered with so as to avoid medical disputes. Security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed Healthchain is applicable for smart healthcare system.},
