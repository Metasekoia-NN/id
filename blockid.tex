\section{Introduction}
Blockchain is an attractive technology for distributed identity management due to its security features, such as append-only and non-tempering storage, decentralized consensus, and reliable trust estabilishment. Compared with traditional identity system, such as PKI (public key infrastructure), the characture of blockchain-based method suits better in current and future network systems, where

\section{Construction}
\subsection{Revocation-Aware Block Format}
The block structure in this paper is desgined to make lightweight node aware of critical ledger status, e.g., user revocation. 

Block header \dots

[Two flag bits, consensus field is modeled as a PoW method]

Transactions \dots

[transactions are structured as normal MHT if no revocation happens. When any flag is ..., the difference is introduced]

\subsection{Parameter Determine for Bloom Filter}

The length of Bloom Filter in this paper can be dramatically decreased compared with other schemes for certificate revocation. This section gives a theoretical derivation for the relevant parameter.

Let $n, \delta$ be the possible maximal number of registered and revoked users, respectively. The remaining factor is system effect of user revocation: when revocation is executed in one consensus round, the expected affected users should be limited to $\theta$, which can be measured as the member amount of Accumulator $\Delta$. The measurement is feasible as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Larger member amount in $\Delta$ causes larger probability that a user to be revoked has already in $\Delta$ and more other members to update their auxiliary information as \eqref{xxx}.
    \item The probability that innocent users applies for accumulator member affects the increase rate of $\theta$. Thus, $\theta$ also implies the effect when revocation is executed just in bloom filter.
\end{itemize}

Assume $m$ is the calculated hash length with $k$ hash functions in the Bloom filter. With $\delta$ users already be revoked, the probability can be measured as follows, that an legal user is erroneously claimed as a revoked one: 
\begin{align} 
    \Pr(1) \simeq (1 - e^{-k\delta/m})^k 
 \end{align}

The parameter $k$ can be individually optimized to minimize $\Pr(1)$ as $ k = \frac{m}{\delta}\ln 2$. Then, for $n$ valid users, the expected ... (limited to $\theta$) is 
\begin{align}\label{eq:bloomfilter}
    \theta = n \cdot (1 - e^{-k\delta/m})^{k} = 0.5^{\frac{m}{\delta}\ln 2}\cdot n
\end{align}
From \eqref{eq:bloomfilter}, the parameters of Bloom filter can be determined as 
\begin{align}
m = & \frac{\ln \frac{n}{\theta} \cdot \delta}{(\ln 2)^2} \simeq 2.08\delta \cdot\ln \frac{n}{\theta}\\
k = & \lfloor \ln \frac{n}{\theta} / \ln 2 \rceil \simeq \lfloor 1.44 \ln \frac{n}{\theta} \rceil
\end{align}

\section{Security Analysis of AcBF}
\begin{theorem}\label{theo:security}
	The AcBF identity management achieves sound and revocation-detectable user authentication for the lightweight-node verifier.
\end{theorem}

\begin{IEEEproof}
    A user without a registered certificate in public ledger (even without a revoked identity) will not forge an authentication due to the traditional certificate technique with trust SPV method. Thus, this proof mainly focuses on the revoked user. Formally, this theorem holds if a revoked user $\mathcal{A}$ wins the following challenges with negligible advantage.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item With the knowledge of accumulator value $\Delta$, as well as any pair of other user's accumulator pair from authentication message \ref{section:authentication}, $\mathcal{A}$ tries to forge its auxiliary value.
        \item When $\mathcal{A}$ goes through a revocation based on member delete in $\Delta$, it tries to forge a new auxiliary value for the updated $\Delta$.
        \item When $\mathcal{A}$ is revoked in block $j$, it tries to hide the revocation fact during the broadcast of block header.
    \end{enumerate}

    The first 2 challenges require a secure cryptographic accumulator, and a strong blockchain protocol is in need for the last challenge. Hence, the demonstration of Theorem \ref{theo:security} can be derived from the following 2 lemmas.
\end{IEEEproof}
\begin{lemma}
    accumulator
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
    blockchain
\end{lemma}
